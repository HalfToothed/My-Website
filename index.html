	<!-- About me -->

	<div class="about block">
		<p class="heading">About Me</p>
		<div class="text">I completed my Bachelors of Computer Application degree from Govt. Holkar Science Collage, Indore. Fueled by a passion for learning and collaboration, I am interested in building products that can solve real-world problems. While I am most proficient at coding in <p class="highlight">Javascript</p> and learning Data Structure & Algoriths in <p class="highlight">C++</p>, I am always looking to expand my knowledge.
			<br> After learning C and C++ at collage I self-learned <p class="hightlight">Javascript, HTML, CSS </p>and hard-coded this website without using any templates or frameworks. I will continue updating it as I learn tools such as React and Bootstrap.
			<br> Last but not least, my experience as a front-end intern at Yums Advertising has taught me how to optimize user experience and refined my communication skills within a team-based environment. I look forward to continue developing leadership and teamwork skills through contributions to open source, personal/group projects, and internships.
